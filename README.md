# Spline

Spline is an interactive page I made in early 2023 designed to teach some of the basics for working with splines and curves, both important concepts in computer science and animation.
It was inspired by an excellent video essay by Freya Holm√©r, available on YouTube [here](https://youtu.be/jvPPXbo87ds).
This is possibly my favourite project I've done - I learned a ton about vector graphics and animation, and inadvertently learned a fairly significant amount of linear algebra.
